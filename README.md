# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis in the Tech Industry

## 📌 Project Overview

Mental health significantly impacts employee productivity, engagement, and retention. The **tech industry**, despite its rapid growth, faces challenges such as burnout, isolation, and high stress. Many organizations lack consistent mental health support programs.

This project leverages **MySQL** to design a relational database and perform analytical queries that uncover trends, gaps, and insights into workplace mental health.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze employee responses regarding mental health awareness and challenges.
* Evaluate company mental health programs and managerial training.
* Identify patterns in remote work, isolation, and productivity.
* Provide actionable insights to improve workplace well-being.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Employee survey responses and company program details.
2. **Database Design** – Normalized relational tables in MySQL.
3. **Data Processing** – Inserted and cleaned records for accuracy.
4. **Data Analysis** – SQL queries to detect trends and highlight gaps.
5. **Reporting** – Summarized findings to guide HR and policy improvements.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The database consists of six main tables:

* **emp\_response** – Employee demographics & mental health history.
* **company\_info** – Company details (industry type, region, etc.).
* **mh\_programs** – Mental health programs and their quality.
* **mgr\_training** – Managerial training and support follow-up.
* **remote\_status** – Remote work details, isolation, and productivity.
* **support\_access** – Employee support, resource awareness, and comfort level.

## 📊 Key SQL Queries & Insights

* Companies offering mental health programs and their quality.
* Employees with a history of mental health issues per company.
* Remote employees experiencing isolation.
* Companies with managers trained in mental health awareness.
* Gender and age distribution of employees with mental health history.
* Organizations lacking structured mental health programs.

## 📈 Conclusion

* Mental health program adoption varies widely across companies.
* Remote work boosts productivity for some but causes isolation for others.
* Managerial training is inconsistent across industries.
* Many non-tech and smaller companies lack structured support systems.

**Future Scope**

* Integration with real-time survey tools.
* Predictive analytics to anticipate burnout risks.
* AI-driven mental health risk assessments.
